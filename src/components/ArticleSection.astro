    <h2>CRTV JAM — Your Weekly Creative Escape</h2>
    <p class="sectionText">
      CRTV Jam is our ongoing creative escape. Every week we touch down in a new
      city — this week: Berlin. The walls, the streets, the hidden corners and
      loud voices become our inspiration, transformed into prompts that spark
      new ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="sectionText">
      Three times a week — Monday, Wednesday, Friday — we drop a fresh prompt
      connected to the place we're in. That word or phrase is your invitation to
      create. What you make is entirely up to you: a quick sketch, a photo roll,
      a stitched pattern, a home-cooked dish, a digital remix, a mural, a
      melody. There are no limits, only openings.
    </p>
    <p class="sectionText">
      When you're ready, share it with us. If you want the spotlight, we'll tag
      you and put your name out there. If you'd rather stay behind the curtain,
      we'll post it anonymously. This way you can explore freely, whether you're
      an upcoming artist searching for exposure or someone testing the waters of
      your own creativity.
    </p>
    <p class="sectionText">
      Every Sunday we gather the week's creations and showcase them side by
      side. The result is a collective canvas: a snapshot of how one city can be
      reimagined in a hundred different ways. CRTV Jam isn't about perfection.
      It's about process, play, and finding new ways to escape through making.
      Join us, and turn the next prompt into your own creative jam.

    <h2>Berlin Free Gem — RAW Energy on Revaler Straße</h2>
    <p class="sectionText">
      East Berlin hides a place where the city's raw spirit lives in full color.
      Just off Revaler Straße, the former train repair yard known as RAW Gelände
      has transformed into one of the city's most eclectic cultural spots. What
      looks like an abandoned industrial site is now a maze of graffiti-covered
      walls, hidden corners, and open-air art. Every surface is painted, tagged,
      layered, and repainted — a free gallery that shifts with the city itself.
    </p>
    <p class="sectionText">
      In the middle of it all stands Urban Spree, part gallery, part music
      venue, part garden hangout. Here you'll find exhibitions, murals, and
      installations that change regularly — some free to explore, others
      spilling outside for everyone to see. Around the area, you'll stumble upon
      bars, cafés, food stalls, and even a skate hall. Cassiopeia offers
      concerts and club nights, while tucked in between it all you might spot
      one of Berlin's quirkiest attractions: a tiny disco hidden inside an old
      phone booth.
    </p>
    <p class="sectionText">
      What makes this a true Free Gem is the art you don't have to pay for. The
      walls themselves are alive, constantly rewritten by Berlin's graffiti and
      street art community. Walking through RAW feels like stepping inside a
      living canvas — chaotic, unfinished, always changing. Whether you're there
      for the galleries, a beer in the sun, or just to wander, the area is proof
      of how Berlin keeps creating in public.
